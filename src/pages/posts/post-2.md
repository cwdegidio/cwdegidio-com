The new year is only a few hours old, so it's time to get my 2024 goal list out there:

1. Write a minimum of one new article for this site a week. These should be technical dives, not just personal journaling.
2. Finish polishing my first iOS app for the App Store and _release it_!
3. Look for new employment opportunities.
4. Finish at least 6 courses in my MSCS program.
5. Get outside and be social; look to getting involved in the local tech community more.
6. Run my first real 5k and start a regular weight regimen.
7. Consume less social media and consume more long reads (books, articles, etc).

This year I am also committing to more "learning in public." It was a prime motivator in me rebuilding my site. I use 
Notion as my engineering notebook, but there are several topics I've already been tracking in it that I would like to 
do deeper dives on for my own benefit. If I can help others along the way, I'm more than happy to.

Happy new year!
