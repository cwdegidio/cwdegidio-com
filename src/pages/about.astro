        <article>
                <p>
                        This is the personal blog of myself, Curtis W. DeGidio. I've been a software developer for over ten years,
                        focusing primarily on web development. I've created this site as a place to write on the many topics that
                        I enjoy, such as programming, traveling, fleeting thoughts, table-top role-playing games, or whatever else
                        suits me.
                </p>
                <p>
                        This site has gone through many iterations. What I have been striving for the last few years is something
                        that is simple and easy to maintain. I've stumbled upon Astro, a static site generator that is easy to
                        work with and lets me focus on writing instead of working with a full-feature CMS. I currently work in
                        Adobe Experience Manager for my regular job and don't like bringing that complexity home with me ðŸ¤£.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Another goal of this website is to "learn in public." I've always enjoyed watching folks openly share
                        their learning journeys. When I was completing my BSCS, I wish I had done more to document how I was
                        growing as a developer. Currently I am working on my MSCS and want to do more in keeping a journal of
                        how I'm doing and what I am learning.
                </p>
                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <h3>As a developer, what are your interests?</h3>
                <p>
                        As I mentioned I've been a developer for many years. Although I have worked in the web development
                        for a long time as a front-end developer (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express, React, Angular, etc), I've spent the last few
                        years working as a full-stack developer (adding Java, Spring/Spring Boot to my skill set). I also enjoy
                        working with SQL and databases. I like experimenting with containers and writing my own APIs, my most recent
                        being an API to support an iOS application I am working to bring to the App Store.
                </p>
                <h3>You like to travel. Where have you been?</h3>
                <p>
                        I've been everywhere man...ðŸ˜†. Recently I went to Italy to visit the town where my family is from, San Polo Matese.
                        This included stops in Rome, Pompeii, and Amalfi. I go to the Caribbean frequently as I love scuba diving whenever
                        I get the chance. I've been to Puerto Rico, Cayman Brac, Mexico, Canada, Belize, Nepal, Thailand, Japan, and Hong Kong. Future
                        trips I am planning are another trip to Italy, a river boat trip on the Amazon River, and Morocco. Here in the States,
                        I like getting up to the Pacific Northwest whenever I can. I think the hiking in the Mount Rianier area is some of the
                        best the US offers.
                </p>
                <h3>What role-playing games do you enjoy?</h3>
                <p>
                        I'm a big fan of the old-school renaissance movement in the gaming community. My favorite game to play is
                        BECMI Dungeons & Dragons. I really enjoy the cleaned up B/X D&D rules of Old-School Essentials. Other systems
                        I have played and would love to get back to are Cyberpunk 2020 or Red, old-school Shadowrun, and Call of Cthulhu.
                        I also enjoy war games, my favorite being the Command & Colors Ancients series.
